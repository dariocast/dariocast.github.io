## Welcome to my website!

Hello, I'm Dario Castellano and this is my personal page, ***D Repo*** (pronounced *"the repo"*) . I'm an IT Scientist with experience in digital identity, having worked on various projects related to blockchain, UI/UX, digital identity, amateur football and so on. I have contributed to IT research during my PhD and enjoy sharing insights on development tip and tricks, new findings in tech and notes on how I solved something.

<!-- I have a passion for [Key Interests or Hobbies], and in my spare time, I enjoy working on [Side Projects, Open Source Contributions, etc.]. You can explore my [Gallery]({{< ref "gallery.md" >}}) to see some of my work and projects. -->

I also (try to) maintain a [Blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}) where I share thoughts on differnet things.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out through my social media links or email under the [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) tab.
